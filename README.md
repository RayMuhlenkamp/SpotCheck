# SpotCheck
**Overview**

  SpotCheck is an mobile application for Android developed by UCSB students [Arielle Robles](https://github.com/rarielle), [Kai Labasan](https://github.com/labasan), [Nathan Inge](https://github.com/nathan-inge), [Juan Manzo](https://github.com/juanmanzo), and [Ray Muhlenkamp](https://github.com/RayMuhlenkamp). A parking spot marketplace, SpotCheck gives parking spot owners a platform to offer their spots to potential renters, while helping car owners seamlessly find open parking spots nearby. SpotCheck shows the surrounding area using the Google Maps API, and displays all parking spots in the area that SpotCheck users have currently up for rent. 

  Using persistent user profiles, SpotCheck users can see all their current listings, whether as a buyer or seller, and edit their profile as well as their owned spots. They can search the map to find the location they want to go to, be it a sporting stadium, concert venue, or any other such destination, and look around the surrounding areas for currently available spots. Upon finding a suitable spot, a user can directly email the spotâ€™s owner to coordinate the details of the rent, specifically payment and exact durations. 

  SpotCheck provides a platform for many people whose needs were not previously met to connect, be it for temporary parking solutions or more long-term leases. It is the hope of the development team that this document can clarify and expand upon what has been mentioned in this brief introduction.
